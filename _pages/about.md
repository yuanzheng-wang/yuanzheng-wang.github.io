Welcome to my homepage! (Last updated in Nov. 2024.)

I am a first-year graduate student at the [Department of Mathematics, MIT](https://math.mit.edu/). 
Before coming to MIT, I completed my undergradute study at the [School of Mathemacitcal Sciences, Peking University](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/), where I was grateful to be advised by Prof. [Jian Ding](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/teachers/dingjian/index.html) and Prof. [Xinyi Li](http://faculty.bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~xinyili/). 

My research interests mainly lie in probability theory and its intersection with statistical physics, analysis and combinatorics.

My email address is yuanz210 at mit dot edu.
