Welcome to my homepage! (Last updated at Nov. 2023.)

I'm an undergraduate student at the [School of Mathematical Sciences, Peking University](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/).

My research interests mainly lie in probability theory and its intersection with statistical physics, combinatorics and geometry.

My email address is arenwyz at stu dot pku dot edu dot cn.
